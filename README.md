# Breakout-Game
A JAVA based Breakout game influenced by the game built by Steve Wozniak aided by Steve Jobs. The player has to eliminate all the layers of bricks present by hitting them with a ball with the help of a paddle. It was a part of the Stanford's CS106A course which I completed online all by myself.

#Running The Game
This game can be played by executing the java file. You will need to add an external jar file i.e. acm.jar in your project because of the libraries used in the project. You should also have the audio file bounce.au present in the game project folder.

NOTE: The game response is machine dependent. The ball speed is made to increase as the game progresses but the speed response might not go well.
