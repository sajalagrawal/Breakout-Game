# Breakout-Game
A JAVA based Breakout game influenced by the game built by Steve Wozniak aided by Steve Jobs. The player has to eliminate all the layers of bricks present by hitting them with a ball bouncing off a paddle. It was a part of the Stanford's CS106A course.

#Running The Game
This game can be played by executing the provided java file. You will need to add an external jar file i.e. acm.jar in your project because of the packages used in the project. The game project folder should also contain the audio file "bounce.au".

NOTE: The game response is machine dependent. The ball velocity is made to increase as the game progresses but the speed response might not go well.
